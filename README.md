# Sous Chef

A personal development project to learn app development with Flutter. The app is a cooking assistant that allows you to define the way in which you cook each ingredient, then combines those instructions into a single recipe. The user can then specify a time at which they would like the recipe to be copmleted and the app will tell them at what time they need to start each instruction.
The idea behind this was to help organise cooking a roast dinner as it is the timing of each ingredient in the dinner that is difficult to manage.

## Current Status

Short-term goals
* Add notifications for each instruction when cooking
* Add optional timer for each instruction when cooking
* Turn list of ingredients into a recipe

Long-term goals
* Allow users to connect with friends to share their ingredients and recipes
